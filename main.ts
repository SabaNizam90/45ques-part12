//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names : string [] = ["Dua Fatima","Sakina","Sarfaraz"];

let message : string = "When we make next plan to go out for lunch after the class?"
console.log(names + " "+ message);
